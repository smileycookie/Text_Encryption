## 📌 Overview
This project is a command-line-based Text Encryption and Decryption Tool that supports AES, DES, and RSA encryption algorithms. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text while ensuring confidentiality and data protection.

## ✨ Features
- 🔐 Encrypt and decrypt text using AES, DES, and RSA algorithms
- 🛡️ Automatic detection of encryption method during decryption
- 🎨 Colored terminal output for better readability
- 🔑 Secure key generation for AES, DES, and RSA
- 📜 Base64 encoding for obfuscation

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 💻 Google Colab (IDE)
- 🔏 PyCryptodome (for encryption algorithms)
- 🎨 Colorama (for colored terminal output)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### ✅ Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.x installed on your system
- 📦 Required libraries installed (see `requirements.txt`)

### 📖 Steps to Run the Project
1. 📥 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smileycookie/Text_Encryption.git
   ```
2. 📂 Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd text-encryption-tool
   ```
3. 📌 Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. ▶️ Run the script:
   ```bash
   python text_encryption.py
   ```

Alternatively, you can run the script directly in Google Colab by uploading the notebook and executing the cells.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- 🖥️ Implement GUI for better user experience
- 🗄️ Add file encryption support
- 🔑 Enhance key management and security
- 🔄 Include hybrid encryption methods
